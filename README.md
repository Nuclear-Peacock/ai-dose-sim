# Phase 2: AI in Image Acquisition & Reconstruction

### Educational Simulation
This tool demonstrates the theoretical application of AI denoising algorithms in Radiology Phase 2 workflows (Image Acquisition). It simulates the "Low Dose vs. Image Quality" trade-off that AI reconstruction aims to solve.

**Concept Demonstrated:**
AI algorithms allow for lower radiation dose protocols by reconstructing diagnostic-quality images from noisy, low-dose raw data.

### How to Use
1. **Launch the Tool:** [Link will go here once deployed]
2. **Move the Slider:** - **Left:** Simulates a raw low-dose acquisition (High Noise).
   - **Right:** Simulates the AI-reconstructed output (High Fidelity).

### Disclaimer
**EDUCATIONAL USE ONLY.** This is a JavaScript-based visual simulation using Gaussian noise injection. It does not run a clinical Deep Learning reconstruction model (e.g., DLIR) and should not be used for diagnostic decision-making.
